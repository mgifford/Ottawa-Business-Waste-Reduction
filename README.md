### Not allowed in the green bin
- Plastic bags of any kind (even the compostable varieties aren’t allowed)
- Plastic impedes the composting process and prevents the flow of air through the organic material, causing it to smell. It also reduces the quality of compost and increases the cost for processing. Plastic residue still needs to be disposed of after composting and increases the amount of material that must be screened out of compost and sent to the landfill.
- Diapers and sanitary products (as they contain plastics)
- Dog feces
- The City's Green Bin program does not accept compostable or biodegradable plastic bin liners.
- Clothing and textiles do not belong in your green bin. If you cannot donate this item, it can be disposed of through your regular curbside garbage.
- Plastic bags are NOT accepted
- Any material or tree cuttings over 10 cm (4 in.) in diameter
- No earth, rocks or sod
- No logs or stumps
- Leaf and yard waste should not be mixed with any other type of waste
